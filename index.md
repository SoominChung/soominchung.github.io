## About Me

Hello! üåø
I am a medical AI researcher with an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) [Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/snuh-bmi-lab/home/), advised by [Prof. Kwangsoo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=en&user=GCDi44QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
I have conducted research developing AI models to address real-world clinical challenges, leveraging diverse clinical data sources, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), vital signs, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG).
Looking ahead, I aim to integrate multi-modal data generated across the patient‚Äôs life course‚Äîsuch as clinical records, medical imaging, biosignals, and EHR‚Äîto advance personalized healthcare.

üìç Currently, I am preparing PhD applications for Fall 2026 entry in several countries. If you are interested in potential collaborations or discussions, please feel free to reach out!
