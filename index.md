## About Me

Hello! ðŸŒ¿
I am a medical AI researcher with an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) [Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/snuh-bmi-lab/home/), advised by [Prof. Kwangsoo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=en&user=GCDi44QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
I have conducted research developing AI models to address diverse clinical problems using hospital data, including Electronic Medical Records (EMR), vital signs, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG).
Looking ahead, I aim to integrate multi-modal data generated across the patientâ€™s life courseâ€”such as clinical records, medical imaging, biosignals, and EMRâ€”to advance personalized healthcare.

## Research Interests

- **Medical AI (AI4Health):** clinical decision support, biosignal analysis (ECG, vital signs), EHR, longitudinal modeling
- **AI Methodologies:** multi-modal learning, representation alignment, reinforcement learning
