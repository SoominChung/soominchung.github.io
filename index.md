## About Me

Hello! 🌿
I am a medical AI researcher with an M.S. in Bioengineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) [Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/snuh-bmi-lab/home/), advised by [Prof. Kwangsoo Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?hl=en&user=GCDi44QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
My research focuses on multimodal and longitudinal modeling for clinical decision support, using biosignals (e.g., ECG, EMG, vital signs) and electronic health records.
I am particularly interested in developing clinically meaningful AI systems that leverage longitudinal patient trajectories and wearable-based continuous monitoring to enable more personalized and proactive healthcare.


📍 I am currently preparing PhD applications for Fall 2026 entry, and I always welcome the chance to connect with others—please feel free to reach out!
